This training setting is the proposed approach without using dynamic memory module. The amount of memory data allocated for each previous task is the same.
Similar to D-GSM-training, you need to create folder "checkpoint" with sub-folders named "social-stgcnn-XX" to contain trained models. Under default settings, "XX" includes "MA", "FT", "ZS", "EP", and "SR".
If you want to set your own directions, please change the directions in the python files, too.
