Use the preprocess_for_learning.py to preprocess raw datasets.

Then, you need to create file folds as provided "1-MA" which contains three sub folds: "train", "val", and "test".

If you are going to running continual training, please firstly process other datasets here. (to fit the default direction in codes, please use "2-FT", "3-ZS", "4-EP", and "5-SR" to name your file folds.)


[Processed Data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KVu8kqf9rOQshXAmJV3EGyW5ivyGoYG4/view?usp=share_link) for default settings.
